## About Semester 1 assignments 

These assignments contain solutions to programming exercises from **"C How to Program"** by Paul Deitel and Harvey Deitel (with an introduction to C++).

### Implementation Constraints

As per the instructor's requirements, **standard libraries (string.h, math.h, etc.) were not permitted**. Therefore, nearly all tasks utilize custom implementations of standard functions, with `conio.h` used for input handling.

### Repository Structure

The folders contain solutions to various exercises from the textbook, demonstrating fundamental C programming concepts through hands-on problem-solving.

**Note:** These implementations are educational exercises focused on understanding low-level manipulation without relying on built-in library functions.
